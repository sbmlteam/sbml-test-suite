The Preferences Panel
---------------------

![Image of the Preferences panel.](preferences-screenshot.png "The Preferences panel.")

In the top portion of the panel, the first field titled _Test Cases
Directory_ will be automatically pre-configured with a path to a folder where
the archive of SBML test cases is unpacked.  You should not need to change
this value except in special circumstances.

The middle portion of the panel is concerned with the definition of wrappers.
The list in the left-hand side permits you to define more than one wrapper;
this can be useful, for example, if you are testing an application using
different options, or testing different applications.  This list is the same
shown in the drop-down menu in the toolbar of the main SBML Test Runner
window once you exit the Preferences dialog.  The Add and Remove buttons
below the list in this panel enable you to manage the list of known wrappers.
The set of fields to the right of the list are the fields that let you define
the characteristics of an individual wrapper.  The meanings of these fields
are described in a separate section of this help document titled [Defining
Wrappers](defining-wrappers.html).

Note that the SBML Test Runner starts up with one pseudo-wrapper definition
named &quot;_-- no wrapper --_&quot;.  This is a view-only wrapper that
allows you to browse the test cases provided in the SBML Test Suite, and
nothing more.  The &quot;_-- no wrapper --_&quot; pseudo-wrapper is always
present and cannot be deleted or altered.

The final section at the bottom of the Preferences panel contains some
additional general options.

 * **Delete existing output files before each invocation**: When set (the
   default value), this causes the SBML Test Runner to delete output results
   files before invoking the wrapper on each test case.  If the deletion
   fails, it reports an error (as a "black" color in the results map).  This
   setting helps prevent situations in which an output file is locked by
   another process (e.g., open in an Excel window on Windows) and the wrapper
   does not return an error value when it tries to write to the file.  In
   that situation, the Test Runner would have no way of knowing that a
   problem occurred and that the wrapper did not actually produce a new
   result.  (If the wrapper could be counted on to always return an error,
   then there wouldn't be a potential problem, but not all wrappers behave as
   expected.)  By attempting to delete the file first, the Test Runner can
   detect a possible problem ahead of time and tell the user something is
   wrong.  However, if this behavior causes problems for your testing
   scenario, you can turn off the behavior by unchecking this checkbox.

 * **Explicitly set number of threads used**: This option only has a meaning
   when a wrapper definition has the **Wrapper can be run in parallel**
   option turned on.  When that option is set, the SBML Test Runner uses
   multiple process threads to run multiple copies of the wrapper in
   parallel.  The number of threads is set to the number of CPU cores minus
   one.  If you prefer to change the number of threads used, set this
   checkbox to true and supply a number in the associated text field.
   (Warning: do not set the value to a very high number, or you may find your
   computer becomes so burdened that the SBML Test Runner, or indeed the
   entire computer, becomes sluggish or even stops responding.)

 * **Watch displayed results file and automatically reanalyze test case if
   the file changes**: When enabled, this option makes the Test Runner
   monitor the file containing the application output currently being plotted
   in the main panel.  If the file changes (even without running the case in
   the Test Runner), the Test Runner will automatically reanalyze and replot
   the results.  This can be useful if you are developing software and are
   using an external application to update the results for a particular test
   case under scrutiny.  Only the currently-displayed results file is
   monitored in this way.

 * **Always check for new versions of test cases**: When enabled, this option
   causes the Test Runner to contact the network update location and check
   for new versions of test cases.  It will do this once automatically when
   it is first started up.

Whether the last option is enabled or not, you can always check for
updates manually by using the "Check for Updates..." item in the Help
menu.
