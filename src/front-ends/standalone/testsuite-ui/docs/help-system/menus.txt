The Menus in the Menu Bar
-------------------------

In the SBML Test Runner's application menu bar, you will find a number of menus that range from the standard menu items to ones specific to the Test Runner.  Here follows a summary of each of the menus and their contents, taken in left-to-right order of the menus.

The first menu in the menu bar when running under Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X (and unique to that operating system) is the application menu.

![The application menu under Mac OS X.](macosx-application-menu.png "The Application menu under Mac OS X.")

The application menu contains the items **About&nbsp;SBML&nbsp;Test&nbsp;Runner**, **Preferences...**, then several items common to all Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X applications, and finally the **Quit&nbsp;SBML&nbsp;Test&nbsp;Runner** item.  Selecting the **About** menu item will bring forth a dialog describing the version and other information about the running copy of the SBML Test Runner.  The **Preferences** menu item will invoke the _Preferences_ panel, which is also the dialog panel used to configure application wrappers.  Finally, the **Quit** menu item will ... (wait for it) quit the SBML Test Runner.

The next menu is titled **File**:

The following are the items in the **File** menu and their meanings:

 * **Show Results Map**: Seleting this menu item will bring up a grid-shaped map of all test case results.  This is the same map invoked by the left-most icon (the grid icon) in the SBML Test Runner's main window.

 * **Refresh All Test Results**: This item causes the SBML Test Runner to re-read all of the results from the output files generated by the wrapped application.

 * **Open Cases Archive**: This menu item is used to deliberately select an archive of test cases to use as the tests, instead of the tests currently being used by the Test Runner.  This may be useful if you are working with different versions of the test suite.

 * **Edit Wrappers**: Selecting this menu item will bring forth the _Preferences_ panel, allowing you to edit the application wrapper definitions.  (This item is simply a synonym for the **Preferences...** item in the Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X application menu.)

Moving along in the menu bar, the next menu is the **Edit** menu:

![The **Edit** menu under Mac OS X.](edit-menu.png "The Edit menu.")

The following are the items in the **Edit** menu and their meanings:

 * **Select All**: This menu item selects all of the test cases in the Test Runner.  This menu item is useful when you want to re-run all of the test cases, even those that have a result recorded already: use **Select All** and then invoke **Run** (either from the menus, or using the key binding command- or control-R, or using the toolbar item in the main Test Runner window).  Another use for this menu item is when you want to select all but a few test cases: invoke **Select All**, then command- or control-click on those test cases you wish to _exclude_.

 * **Deselect All**: This menu item deselects all of the test cases.

 * **Jump to Case**: Selecting this menu item brings forth a small dialog that lets you type in the number of a test case. Upon pressing the return key in the dialog, the Test Runner will jump to that test case and display the results.

To the right of the **Edit** men is the **Filter** menu:

![The **Filter** menu under Mac OS X.](filter-menu.png "The Filter menu.")

 * **Filter Visible Test Cases**: This menu item invokes the _Filter_ dialog panel, which you can use to limit the test cases displayed according to numeric ranges and/or test types.

 * **Clear All Filters**: Selecting this menu item undoes the effects of any filters previously set using the **Filter Visible Test Cases** option, and reverts to displaying all test cases.

 * **Show Only Problematic Entries**: This menu item filters the visible test cases to just those for which the application produced one of the following kinds of results: 

    * The results do not match the results expected for the test case.
    * The application does not support one or more of the tags associated with the test case.
    * The application did not produce a result for the test case.
    * An error occurred while trying to run the wrapper for the test case.

 * **Show Only Really Problematic Entries**: This is a more limited version of the previous menu item; this one shows only the most serious problems with the test results produced by the application.  It filters the visible test cases to just those for which the application produced one of the following kinds of results: 

    * The results do not match the results expected for the test case.
    * The application did not produce a result for the test case.
    * An error occurred while trying to run the wrapper for the test case.

 * **Show Only Supported Tests**:  This menu item filters the visible test cases to just those for which the application is known to produce a result.  It does this by excluding cases that (1) have tags listed in the **Unsupported tags** field of the wrapper definition in the _Preferences_ menu, or (2) are not of the currently selected SBML Level+Version combination (chosen using the pull-down menu in the toolbar of the main Test Runner window).

Next in line in the menu bar is the **Test** menu:

![The **Test** menu under Mac OS X.](test-menu.png "The Test menu.")

 * **Run**: Selecting this menu item causes the Test Runner to run the currently selected test cases, or if none are selected, run all test cases.  This menu item is synonymous with the _Run_ button in the toolbar of the main window.

 * **Run By Tag and/or Number**: This menu item invokes a dialog that allows you to selectively run only those test cases that contain specific tags or have specific test numbers.

 * **Run All Tests**: This is a synonym for selecting all the test cases and then invoking the **Run** menu option.

 * **Run All Supported Tests**: This menu item causes the Test Runner to run (or rerun) those test cases which the application wrapper is _not_ configured in some way to exclude; i.e., those tests which are not among the ones excluded due to unsupported tags or SBML Level/Version combination.

 * **Run All New Tests**: This menu item causes the Test Runner to run (or rerun) just those test cases for which the application wrapper has not produced a result.  (These are cases for which the results are labeled with a gray color.)  This can be useful during development of a wrapper or application to see the consequences of a change, for example if you make a change to the wrapper configuration that allows the application to produce a result where it didn't before.

 * **Refresh Selected Result(s)**: This menu item causes the Test Runner to reread the results files for the selected test cases.  This is useful if you have done something to modify or update the results from outside of the Test Runner.

 * **Delete Selected Result(s)**: Selecting this menu item causes the Test Runner to delete the results files for the corresponding test cases.  This is a destructive operation.

 * **View Process Output**: This menu item allows you to see the output (if any) produced by the wrapper for a given test case. This can be very helpful when debugging test wrappers.

Finally, the last menu in the menu bar is the **Help** menu:

![The **Help** menu under Mac OS X.](help-menu.png "The Help menu.")

 * **Help**: Selecting this menu item invokes the built-in help system to display the information you are currently reading.

 * **Check for Updates...**: Selecting this menu item causes the Test Runner to check for updated test cases.  It does this by contacting the repository used to distribute the SBML Test Suite test case archives (currently, SourceForge.net), comparing the date of the available archive to the date of the tests being used by this copy of the Test Runner, and if the cases on the repository are newer, downloading and installing the test case archive.  If you do not have the automatic updates feature enabled in the _Preferences_ panel, you should periodically run this command to see if updated test cases are available.

 * **Restore test cases**: Reinstall the internally-bundled archive of SBML Test Suite test cases.  This is useful if something has happened to damage the currently-installed test cases, or a previous update or unpacking operation was interrupted and left only a partial collection of test cases.  (Note that invoking this operation will store the test cases in the default location for test cases, regardless of the test case directory configured in the _Preferences_ dialog; this is done to avoid overwriting any special test case directory the user may have set.)

 * (On Windows and Linux only) **About SBML Test Runner**: This menu item displays a dialog describing the version and other information about the running copy of the SBML Test Runner.
