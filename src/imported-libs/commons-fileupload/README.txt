This directory contains the unmodified Apache Commons FileUpload
library, obtained from http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/.  The
Commons FileUpload library provides utilities to assist with
developing file upload capabilities in servlets and web applications.

The Online SBML Test Suite uses the Apache Commons FileUpload library
in its implementation.  The file "commons-fileuload-1.2.jar" is copied
to the directory /var/lib/tomcat5/webapps/test_suite/WEB-INF/lib/ in
the installation of the Online SBML Test Suite.

Apache Commons FileUpload is Copyright 2002-2008 by The Apache
Software Foundation.  The Apache Commons FileUpload licensing terms
are described in the file LICENSE.txt included in this directory.
