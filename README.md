* SBML Test Suite release 3.3.0 &rArr; [10.5281/zenodo.1112521](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/65245545)

‚òÄ Background
----------

<img align="right" src=".graphics/Official-sbml-supported-70.jpg">

Computational modeling has become a crucial aspect of biological research, and [SBML](http://sbml.org) (the Systems Biology Markup Language) has become the de facto standard open format for exchanging models between software tools in systems biology.  At last count, over 280 software tools have provided support for SBML.  However, full support for SBML (especially for numerical simulations of models described by SBML) is a complex undertaking.

The SBML Test Suite can be used by developers to test their understanding of SBML and their software's implementation of SBML support; likewise, the Test Suite can be used by modelers and other users to test the correctness and completeness of SBML support in a software system.  The SBML Test Suite consists of (1) a collection of SBML models, each with associated simulated results where appropriate; (2) a testing framework for running software tools through the suite; and (3) basic documentation on the test cases and the use of the suite.

‚ú∫ The Test Cases
----------------

The SBML Test Suite test cases are divided into 3 sets and distributed separately.  Each tests a different aspect of SBML understanding and compliance.

* *Semantic*: The semantic test suite contains valid SBML models with known, deterministic simulation results.  These models can be used to test the ability of a software system to understand the meaning of different SBML constructs and properly simulate the models in a deterministic fashion.  An example of a deterministic simulator is a system using a numerical differential-algebraic solver that supports discontinuous events.  Each test consists of a directory containing the model (or models, if that model can be translated to other SBML Levels + Version combinations without semantic loss), together with instructions on how to simulate that model, and the expected results.  For more information about the semantic test cases, please look in the file named [README.md](cases/semantic/README.md) in the [cases/semantic/](cases/semantic) subdirectory.

* *Stochastic*: The stochastic test suite contains valid SBML models with known, stochastic simulation results.  These tests exercise fewer features of SBML, and are instead intended to test the accuracy of systems that employ discrete stochastic simulation algorithms.  Each test consists of a directory containing the model (or models, if that model can be translated to other SBML Levels + Version combination without semantic loss), together with instructions on how to simulate that model, and the expected results.  Because the expected results are stochastic, each test case is designed to be performed multiple times, with summary statistics collected for each, which are then compared to the expected summary statistics using a formula derived from the number of times the test was repeated.  For more information about the stochastic test cases, please look in the file named [README.md](cases/stochastic/README.md) in the [cases/stochastic/](cases/stochastic) subdirectory.

* *Syntactic*: The syntactic test suite consists of valid and invalid SBML models.  Each test is designed to check a particular SBML validation rule.  These rules are defined in the SBML specification documents.  Each case model in this part of the Test Suite is expected to be recognized by a software system as being either valid or invalid &ndash; nothing more.  The validity is indicated in the file name of a model.  (Example: `01002-fail-01-01-sev2-l2v1.txt` should fail.)  Details about the error and the error message produced by libSBML are included with each test case description, as are incidental warnings that libSBML may also produce for a given model/test case.  For more information about the stochastic test cases, please look in the file named [README.md](cases/syntactic/README.md) in the [cases/syntactic/](cases/syntactic) subdirectory.


‚ñ∫ The SBML Test Runner
----------------------

The SBML Test Runner can be used to run an application against the collection of semantic test cases in the Test Suite, and report successes and failures.  If you have downloaded a release of the standalone version of the SBML Test Runner, your distribution will consist of a few files and a program named `SBML Test Runner`.    It comes complete with the test cases already included, and it can automatically check for updates to the test cases.  The image below shows an example run from the SBML Test Runner:

More information can be found in a [separate README file](src/test-runner/testsuite-ui) for the SBML Test Runner


‚Åá Getting Help
