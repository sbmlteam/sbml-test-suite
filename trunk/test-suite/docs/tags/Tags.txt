Definitions:                    L/V		Description
-----------                     -----   	----------------------------------------------------
0D-Compartment			L2v1+		A compartment with a value of 0 for its 'spatialDimensions' attribute is present in the model
Amount				all		The value of at least one species is requested to be output in units of amount, not concentration
AssignedConstantStoichiometry	L2v1+		The model contains a stoichiometry value that is assigned by a 'stoichiometryMath' construct (in SBML Level 2) or by an initial assignment, assignment rule, or algebraic rule (in SBML Level 3), but thereafter the value remains constant for the duration of the simulation
AssignedVariableStoichiometry	L2v1+		The model contains a stoichiometry value that is assigned by a 'stoichiometryMath' construct (in SBML Level 2) or by an initial assignment, assignment rule, algebraic rule or event (in Level 3); however, the value is changed over the course of the simulation
BoundaryCondition		all		A species with a value of 'true' for its 'boundaryCondition' attribute is present in the model
Concentration			all		The value of at least one species is requested to be output in units of concentration, not amount
ConstantSpecies			L2v1+		A species with a value of 'true' for its 'constant' attribute is present in the model
ConversionFactors		L2v2+		The model itself, or a species it contains, has a value set for the 'conversionFactor' attribute
EventIsNotPersistent		L3v1+		The simulation behavior of the model is influenced by an event that has a value of 'false' for its 'persistent' attribute (SBML Level 3)
EventIsPersistent		L2v1+		The simulation behavior of the model is influenced by an event that has a value of 'true' for its 'persistent' attribute (SBML Level 3) or is assumed to be persistent by default (SBML Level 2)
EventT0Firing			L2v1+		The model contains at least one event whose 'trigger' component is 'true' at time 0, and whether it fires at time 0 (possible in SBML Level 3; impossible in SBML Level 2) makes a difference to the output of the simulation
EventUsesAssignmentTimeValues	L2v4+		The model contains at least one event whose 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' attribute is set to 'false', and this makes a difference in the output of the simulation
EventUsesTriggerTimeValues	L2v1+		The model contains at least one event whose 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' attribute is set to 'true' (SBML Level 2 Version 4 and later), or which is assumed to use values from the event's trigger time by default (SBML Level 2 prior to Version 4) and this makes a difference in the output of the simulation
FastReaction			all		A reaction with a value of 'true' for its 'fast' attribute is present in the model
HasOnlySubstanceUnits		L2v1+		A species with a value of 'true' for its 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute is present in the model
InitialValueReassigned		all		The initial numerical value of a species, compartment, parameter, or (in SBML Level 3) species reference is determined by an initial assignment, assignment rule, or algebraic rule
LocalParameters			all		The model contains a kinetic law with a 'listOfParameters' (SBML Levels 1-2) or 'listOfLocalParameters' (SBML Level 3)
MultiCompartment		all		At least two compartments are present in the model.
NonConstantCompartment		all		The model contains at least one compartment whose size changes over the course of the simulation
NonConstantParameter		all		The model contains at least one parameter whose value changes over the course of the simulation.
NonUnityCompartment		all		The model contains at least one compartment whose size is not 1.0 for at least part of the duration of the simulation
NonUnityStoichiometry		all		The model contains at least one species reference with a stoichiometry value that is not 1.0 for at least part of the duration of the simulation
RandomEventExecution		L3v1+		The model contains two or more events that execute at the same moment in time, and which have, at that moment, identical priorities, so that correct simulation of the model depends on randomly choosing which event to execute first
ReversibleReaction		all		The model contains at least one reaction whose kinetic law produces a negative value for at least part of the duration of the simulation
SpeciesReferenceInMath		L3v1+		The model contains at least one species reference with an identifier that is used in a mathematical formula elsewhere in the model
comp:ConversionFactor           L3v1+           The model contains at least one replacedElement with a conversionFactor attribute, which affects the interpretation of the math in the model.
comp:ExtentConversionFactor     L3v1+           The model contains at least one submodel with an extentConversionFactor attribute, which affects the interpretation of the reactions in the submodel.
comp:TimeConversionFactor       L3v1+           The model contains at least one submodel with a timeConversionFactor attribute, which affects the interpretation of the math and the reactions in the submodel.
comp:NotRequired                L3v1+           The interpretation of the requested test suite output is numerically identical, whether or not any 'comp' constructs are understood.
comp:SubmodelOutput             L3v1+           The value of at least one non-replaced element of a submodel is requested in the output, denoted by the use of double-underscores in the requested element's ID.

Removed testTags
================
Delay                 removed this as a tag as this is covered by EventWithDelay and CSymbolDelay 
Discontinuity         removed this as a tag as it ties in with events anyway
MathML                removed this as a tag as it isnt really a test case on its own
ZeroRate              removed this as a tag as it isnt really a test case on its own
InitialAmount         (changed to Amount)
InitialConcentration  (changed to Concentration)
MassUnits             (unused)
Units                 (unused)
Constraint	      removed this because it proved untestable
