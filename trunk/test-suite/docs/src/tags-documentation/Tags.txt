Removed testTags
================
Delay - removed this as a tag as this is covered by EventWithDelay and CSymbolDelay 
Discontinuity - removed this as a tag as it ties in with events anyway
MathML - removed this as a tag as it isnt really a test case on its own
ZeroRate - removed this as a tag as it isnt really a test case on its own
