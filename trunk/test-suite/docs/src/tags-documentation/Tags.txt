Removed testTags
================
Delay                 removed this as a tag as this is covered by EventWithDelay and CSymbolDelay 
Discontinuity         removed this as a tag as it ties in with events anyway
MathML                removed this as a tag as it isnt really a test case on its own
ZeroRate              removed this as a tag as it isnt really a test case on its own
InitialAmount         (changed to Amount)
InitialConcentration  (changed to Concentration)
