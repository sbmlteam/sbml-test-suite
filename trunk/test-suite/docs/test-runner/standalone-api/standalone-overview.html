<P> This is the Programmer's Manual for the SBML Test Suite Standalone
application; it describes the internal aspects of the application for
programmers interested in reusing or extending the codebase.

<blockquote>

<b>Authors:</b> The <em>SBML Test Suite Standalone Application</em> and its
documentation was written by Kimberly Begley.

<p>The complete <a target="_blank"
href="http://sbml.org/Software/SBML_Test_Suite">SBML Test Suite</a> was
written by Sarah Keating, Kimberly Begley and Michael Hucka.  It is based
in part on the SBML Semantic Test Suite written by Andrew Finney.

<h2>General information</h2>

<p> The SBML Test Suite is a conformance testing system for SBML. It allows
developers and users to test the degree and correctness of SBML support
provided in an SBML-compatible software package.  The Test Suite provides a
large corpus of valid SBML models, each with representative, simulated time
course data, plot outputs, simulation settings, documentation, and other
information.  Each test case exercises different combinations of SBML
features and components.

<p> The <em>Standalone Application</em> component of the SBML Test Suite is
a test automation system.  It allows a developer or end user to run a
simulation program against the SBML Test Suite cases, collect the results,
compare them to expected results, and report on the successes and failures.

<h2>Communication, bug reports, and related topics</h2>

<p> Please report bugs and other issues with all aspects of the SBML Test
Suite using the tracker at <a target="_blank"
href="http://sbml.org/software/test-suite/issue-tracker">
http://sbml.org/software/test-suite/issue-tracker</a>.

<p> You can also report problems on the <a target="_blank"
href="http://sbml.org/Forums">sbml-interoperability</a> mailing list.  This
may even have advantages, such as that other people may also have
experienced the issue and offer a workaround more quickly than the SBML
Test Suite developers can respond.
