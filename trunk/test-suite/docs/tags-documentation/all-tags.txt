0D-Compartment	L2v1+	A compartment with a value of 0 for its 'spatialDimensions' attribute is present in the model.
Amount	all	The value of at least one species is requested to be output in units of amount, not concentration.
AssignedConstantStoichiometry	L2v1+	The model contains a stoichiometry value that is assigned by a 'stoichiometryMath' construct (in SBML Level 2) or by an initial assignment, assignment rule, or algebraic rule (in SBML Level 3), but thereafter the value remains constant for the duration of the simulation.
AssignedVariableStoichiometry	L2v1+	The model contains a stoichiometry value that is assigned by a 'stoichiometryMath' construct (in SBML Level 2) or by an initial assignment, assignment rule, algebraic rule or event (in Level 3); however, the value is changed over the course of the simulation.

EventIsNotPersistent	L3v1+	The simulation behavior of the model is influenced by an event that has a value of 'false' for its 'persistent' attribute (SBML Level 3).
EventIsPersistent	L2v1+	The simulation behavior of the model is influenced by an event that has a value of 'true' for its 'persistent' attribute (SBML Level 3) or is assumed to be persistent by default (SBML Level 2).
EventT0Firing	L2v1+	The model contains at least one event whose 'trigger' component is 'true' at time 0, and whether it fires at time 0 (possible in SBML Level 3; impossible in SBML Level 2) makes a difference to the output of the simulation.
EventUsesAssignmentTimeValues	L2v4+	The model contains at least one event whose 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' attribute is set to 'false', and this makes a difference in the output of the simulation.
EventUsesTriggerTimeValues	L2v1+	The model contains at least one event whose 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' attribute is set to 'true' (SBML Level 2 Version 4 and later), or which is assumed to use values from the event's trigger time by default (SBML Level 2 prior to Version 4) and this makes a difference in the output of the simulation.

# Removed tags:
# Delay                 Removed this as a tag as this is covered by EventWithDelay and CSymbolDelay.
# Discontinuity         Removed this as a tag as it ties in with events anyway.
# MathML                Removed this as a tag as it isn't really a test case on its own.
# ZeroRate              Removed this as a tag as it isn't really a test case on its own.
# InitialAmount         Changed to Amount.
# InitialConcentration  Changed to Concentration.
# MassUnits             Never used; did not prove to be testable.
# Units                 Never used; did not prove to be testable.
# Constraint            Removed, as it did not prove to be testable.
# 1D-Compartment        Removed, as it did not prove to be testable.
# 2D-Compartment        Removed, as it did not prove to be testable.
# comp:NotRequired      This tag was removed when the interpretation of the 'required' flag was changed to apply to the package as a whole, not individual models.
