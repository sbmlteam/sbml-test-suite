1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

This is the emerging SBML Test Suite, based on earlier work by Andrew
Finney on the "SBML Semantic Test Suite".  It is currently in the
process of being completely revised and improved in many ways.

What is currently available is the original version of the test suite,
which provides test models and expected outputs for each, allowing
developers and users to test the SBML support of software systems.



----------------
2. SAMPLE MODELS
----------------

For further testing and illustration purposes, this suite also
contains a selection of SBML models drawn from different sources such
as the SBML specification and different model repositories.  You will
find these in the subdirectory "extras/sample-models".
