---------------
1. Introduction
---------------

This is a collection of models and associated files intended to serve as a
test set for developers of software with SBML input/output capabilities.
We are still in the process of developing this test suite, and in its
present form, documentation and other assistance are poor.

We welcome new models and other help in refining this test suite into a
resource for the whole community of SBML users and developers.


---------------
2. Installation
---------------

The test suite is currently a collection of files in plain-text (UTF 8)
format.  There is no installation step other than unpacking the files.


--------
3. Usage
--------

You can use the sample files in this collection as test input into your
SBML-compliant software.  Documentation is rather sparse at the moment, so
it is necessary to deduce the purposes of the individual models from the
comments in the files themselves, and occassionally from their directory
locations and file names.
