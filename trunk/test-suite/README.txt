---------------
1. Introduction
---------------

This is a collection of models and associated files intended to serve as a
test set for developers of software with SBML input/output capabilities.
We are still in the process of developing this test suite, and in its
present form, documentation and other assistance are immature.

We welcome new models and other help in refining this test suite into a
resource for the whole community of SBML users and developers.


---------------
2. Installation
---------------

The test suite is currently a collection of files in plain-text (UTF 8)
format.  There is no installation step other than unpacking the files.

If you are obtaining the test suite directly from the CVS server, make sure
to use the -P (prune) option to the CVS check-out command.  Otherwise, you
will receive many deleted files and directories.


--------
3. Usage
--------

You can use the sample files in this collection as test input into your
SBML-compliant software.  Documentation is rather sparse at the moment, so
it is necessary to deduce the purposes of the individual models from the
comments in the files themselves, and occassionally from their directory
locations and file names.
