This model is identical to model 00001, but the species has units of concentration instead of amount.

The model contains:
* 1 species (X)
* 2 parameters (Lambda, Mu)
* 1 compartment (Cell)

There are 2 reactions:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| Birth: X -> 2X | $Lambda * X$ |
| Death: X -> | $Mu * X$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial amount of species X | $100$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter Lambda | $0.1$ | constant |
| Initial value of parameter Mu | $0.11$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'Cell' | $1$ | constant |]

The species' initial quantities are given in terms of substance units to
make it easier to use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but
their symbols represent their values in concentration units where they
appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
