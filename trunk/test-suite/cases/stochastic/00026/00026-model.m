This model is the same as case 00024, but with 'Sink' additionally declared as constant.

The model contains:
* 3 species (X, Source, Sink)
* 2 parameters (Alpha, Mu)
* 1 compartment (Cell)

There are 2 reactions:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| Immigration: Source -> X | $Alpha$ |
| Death: X -> Sink | $Mu * X$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial amount of species X | $0$ | variable |
| Initial amount of species Source | $0$ | variable |
| Initial amount of species Sink | $0$ | constant |
| Initial value of parameter Alpha | $10$ | constant |
| Initial value of parameter Mu | $0.1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'Cell' | $unknown$ | constant |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
