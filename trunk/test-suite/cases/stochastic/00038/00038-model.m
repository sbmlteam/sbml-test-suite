This model is the same as model 00020, with a slightly different stoichiometry for the 'Immigration' reaction, and a different value of 'Mu'.

The model contains:
* 1 species (X)
* 2 parameters (Alpha, Mu)
* 1 compartment (Cell)

There are 2 reactions:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| Immigration: -> 10X | $Alpha$ |
| Death: X -> | $Mu * X$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial amount of species X | $0$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter Alpha | $1$ | constant |
| Initial value of parameter Mu | $0.4$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'Cell' | $unknown$ | constant |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
