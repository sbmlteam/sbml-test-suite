The model assigns avogadro's number as a csymbol to four parameters in an assignment rule.  It tries to fool you by calling two of them 'time' and 'delay', and by not giving one a name at all.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin-left:5em}|       |*Value*          |
|Value of parameter P1               |$6.02214179e+23)$   |
|Value of parameter P2               |$6.02214179e+23)$   |
|Value of parameter P3               |$6.02214179e+23)$   |
|Value of parameter P4               |$6.02214179e+23)$   |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
