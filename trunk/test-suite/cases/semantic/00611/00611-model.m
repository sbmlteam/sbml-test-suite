The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three
species called S1, S2 and S3 and one parameters called k.  The model
contains one reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $C * k * S$  |]

Reaction S1 -> S2 defines one local parameter k which has a
scope local to the defining reaction.

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Assignment | S3 | $k * S2$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*      |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1$          |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$0$          |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$1$          |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k                |$0.75$       |dimensionless |
|Value of local parameter k          |$5$          |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C             |$1$          |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
