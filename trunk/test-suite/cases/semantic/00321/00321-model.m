The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and one parameter named k1.  Compartment
"compartment" is 0-dimensional.  The model contains one reaction defined
as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $k1 * S1$  |]

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Rate | S3 | $0.65$  |]


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|      |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1  |$          1.5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2  |$            0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3  |$            0$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1 |$        1.546$ |second^-1^ |]

In this example the compartment has its spatialDimensions attribute set to
zero; i.e., it represents a point and therefore cannot have size or units.
The species values must be treated as amounts and not concentrations.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical solution
of the system of equations.
