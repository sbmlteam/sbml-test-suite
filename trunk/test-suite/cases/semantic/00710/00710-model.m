The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three
species called S1, S2 and S3 and one parameter called k1.  The model contains
one reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $k1 * S1 * C$  |]

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Rate | S3 | $0.15$  |]


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial concentration of S1                |$          1.5$ |mole litre^-1^                      |
|Initial concentration of S2                |$            0$ |mole litre^-1^                      |
|Initial concentration of S3                |$            0$ |mole litre^-1^                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$          1.5$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C |$         1.75$ |litre                     |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical solution
of the system of equations.
