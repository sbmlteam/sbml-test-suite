The model contains one compartment called C.  There are two
species called S1 and S2 and two parameters called k1 and p1.  The model contains
one reaction:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $k1 * S1 * C$ |]

The model contains one initialAssignment:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| Variable | Formula |
 | S2       | $p1 * S1 * time$  |]
where the symbol 'time' denotes the current simulation time.

Note: SBML's InitialAssignment take effect at time t < 0 and continue to have effect 
up to and including time t = 0, overriding any initial values.  In this model, the 
initial value for the species S1 has not been explicitly declared and must be 
calculated using the InitialAssignment at time = 0. 


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*        |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.5 \x 10^-3$  |mole           |
|Initial amount of S2                |$undeclared$     |mole           |
|Value of parameter p1               |$-0.5$           |second^-1^     |
|Value of parameter k1               |$1$              |second^-1^     |
|Volume of compartment C |$1$              |litre          |]

The species' initial quantities are given in terms of substance units to
make it easier to use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as
per usual SBML principles) their symbols represent their values in
concentration units where they appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
