 The submodel contains a parameter and rate rule, both of which are replaced by the parent model.  This means that it is not actually necessary to understand the 'comp' package to pass the test; a simulator should be able to note the 'required="false"' line and attempt to simulate anyway.

The 'flattened' version of this hierarchical model contains:
* 1 parameter (p8)

There is one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
| Rate | p8 | $3$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial value of parameter p8 | $8$ | variable |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
