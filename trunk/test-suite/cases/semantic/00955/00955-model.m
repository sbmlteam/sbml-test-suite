 The model tests the various mathematical constructs present in L1, as applied to the time variable.  Ironically, this doesn't work in L1, since time isn't present, but hey.

This file doesn't contain a list of the initial conditions, since there are a ton of them.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
