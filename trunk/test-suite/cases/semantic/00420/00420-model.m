The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three species
called S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters called k1 and k2.  Compartment C is
2-dimensional.  The model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * C$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * C$     |]

The model contains two events that assign values to species S2 and S1:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| | *Trigger*   | *Delay* | *Assignments* |
 | Event1                      | $S1 < 0.75$ | $5$     | $S2 = 1$      |
 | Event2                      | $S3 > 1.4$  | $10$    | $S1 = 1$      |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value* |*Units*                      |
|Initial amount of S1          |$1.0$   |mole                         |
|Initial amount of S2          |$2.0$   |mole                         |
|Initial amount of S3          |$1.0$   |mole                         |
|Value of parameter k1         |$0.075$ |metre^2^ mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2         |$0.025$ |second^-1^                   |
|Area of compartment C         |$1$     |metre^2^                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
