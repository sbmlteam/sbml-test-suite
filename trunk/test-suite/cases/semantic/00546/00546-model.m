The model contains one compartment called C.  There are four
species called S1, S2, S3 and S4 and two parameters called k1 and k2.
Compartment C is 0-dimensional.  The model contains two reactions defined as:


[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3$     |]

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Algebraic |   n/a    | $S4 - S1$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*                   |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$2.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$0.75$           |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$0.25$           |second^-1^                |]

In this example the compartment has its spatialDimensions attribute set to
zero; i.e., it represents a point and therefore cannot have size or units.
The species values must be treated as amounts and not concentrations.
