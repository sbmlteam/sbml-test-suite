The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three
species called S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters called k1 and k2.  The model
contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * C$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * C$     |]

The model contains one rule which must be used to determine the value of
compartment C:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Algebraic |   n/a    | $C - 0.75$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*                   |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.0 \x 10^-1$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$2.0 \x 10^-1$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$1.0 \x 10^-1$  |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$7.5$           |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$0.25$           |second^-1^                |
|Volume of compartment C             |$undeclared$              |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
