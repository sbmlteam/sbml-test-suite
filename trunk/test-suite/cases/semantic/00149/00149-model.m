The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are two
species named S1 and S2 and one parameter named k1.  The model contains one
reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $compartment * k1 * S1$  |]

The model contains one rule which assigns value to parameter k1:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Assignment | k1 | $0.75$  |]

In this case the initial value declared for parameter k1 is inconsistent
with the value calculated by the assignmentRule.  The calculated value
should be used.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$          0.1$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$         0.15$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$          750$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
