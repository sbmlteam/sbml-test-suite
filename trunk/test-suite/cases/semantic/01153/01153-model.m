 The parent model in this document contains deletions that remove an initial assignment and a rate rule two levels down.  The parent model contains only an initial assignment for that parameter, leaving it constant.

The 'flattened' version of this hierarchical model contains:
* 4 parameters (z, i, A__A__y, A__A__Q)
The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial value of parameter i | $2$ | constant |
| Initial value of parameter A__A__y | $7$ | constant |
| Initial value of parameter A__A__Q | $2$ | constant |
| Initial value of parameter z | $34 * i$ | variable |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
