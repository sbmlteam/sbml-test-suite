The model contains one varying compartment called c.

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*         |
 | Rate                                 | c           | $0.25 * c$  |]

The model contains one initialAssignment:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| Variable | Formula |
 | c       | $3 / 2$  |]

Note: SBML's InitialAssignment construct override any declared initial
values.  In this model, the initial value for the compartment c is
inconsistent with the value returned by the InitialAssignment.


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*         |*Units*  |
|Size of compartment c         |$2$ |litre        |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
