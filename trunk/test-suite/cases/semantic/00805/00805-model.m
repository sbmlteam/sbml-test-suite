The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three species called 
S1, S2 and S3 and one parameter called k.  The model contains one reaction that has
a kinetic law that defines second order mass action kinetics with two reactants
(as referenced by SBO:0000054):

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k * S1 * S2 * C$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*       |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1        |$1.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2        |$0.5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3        |$0$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k       |$1.1$          |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C     |$1$             |litre                  |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical solution
of the system of equations.
