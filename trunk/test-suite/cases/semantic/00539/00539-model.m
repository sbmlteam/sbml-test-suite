The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three
species called X0, X1 and T and two parameters called k1 and k2.  The model
contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| X0 -> T     | $C * k1 * X0$  |
| T -> X1     | $C * k2 * T$  |]

The model contains one rule which must be used to determine the value of
compartment C:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Algebraic |   n/a    | $C - 1$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value* |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of X0          |$1$     |mole                      |
|Initial amount of X1          |$0$     |mole                      |
|Initial amount of T           |$0$     |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1         |$0.1$   |second^-1^            |
|Value of parameter k2         |$0.375$ |second^-1^                |
|Volume of compartment C       |$undeclared$     |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
