Note:  This test is a copy of model 876, with the products and reactants reversed, and a negative kinetic law.  This gives the same results, but during the simulation, the kinetic law fails to go negative (a requirement for the ReversibeReaction tag).  The reaction listed below is therfore equivalent to the one in the file, but reversed from it.

The model contains one compartment called C.  There are four
species called S1, S2, S3 and S4 and two parameters called kf and kr.  The model
contains one reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 <-> S3 | $(kf * S1 * S2 - kr * S3) * C$  |]

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Algebraic |   n/a    | $S4 - S1$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*                   |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$2.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$0.75$           |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$0.25$           |second^-1^                |
|Volume of compartment C             |$1$              |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
