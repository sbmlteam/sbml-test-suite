The model contains two varying compartments called C1 and C2.

The model contains two rules:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Rate | C1       | $C2 * 0.5 - C1 * 0.2$  |
 | Rate | C2       | $C1 * 0.75-C2 * 2.1$  |]


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*   |*Units*  |
|Size of compartment C1        |$1.5$     |litre        |
|Size of compartment C2        |$1.5$     |litre |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
