The model contains one compartment called C.  There are four
species called S1, S2, S3 and S4 and three parameters called k1, k2 and p1.  The
model contains one reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $k1 * S1 * C$  |]

The model contains two rules:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Rate | S3 | $k2  *  S4$  |
 | Rate | S4 | $-k2  *  S4$  |]

The model contains one initialAssignment:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| Variable | Formula |
 | S1 | $p1 / 0.5$  |]

Note: InitialAssignments override any declared initial values.  In this case the 
value of species S1 calculated by the initialAssignment is inconsisent with the value 
declared by the model definition.  The calculated value should be used.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$          0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$          2.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$          1.5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4                |$            4$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$         0.75$ |second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$         0.25$ |second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter p                |$         0.75$ |mole litre^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical solution
of the system of equations.
