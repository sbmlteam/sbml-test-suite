The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are four
species named S1, S2, S3 and S4 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 0-dimensional.  Both species S1 and S2 are
labeled as an SBML boundary species.  The model contains two reactions
defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 + S4 | $k1 * S1 * S2$  |
| S3 + S4 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * S4$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|      |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1  |$          1.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2  |$          1.5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3  |$          2.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4  |$          0.5$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1 |$          0.6$ |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2 |$         0.13$ |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |]

In this example the compartment has its spatialDimensions attribute set to
zero; i.e., it represents a point and therefore cannot have size or units.
The species values must be treated as amounts and not concentrations.
