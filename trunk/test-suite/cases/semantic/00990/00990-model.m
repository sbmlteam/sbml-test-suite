 The stoichiometry of the reaction '-> nX' is set to be equal to p1, a parameter that starts at 1 and increases at a rate of 1.

 The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin-left:5em}| |*Value*       |
|Initial amount of X        |$1$                  |
|Value of parameter p1       |$1$          |
|Volume of compartment default_compartment     |$1$             |]
