 This model contains submodels three levels deep.  A compartment replacement changes the concentration of a species.

The 'flattened' version of this hierarchical model contains:
* 8 species (S1, sub1__S1, sub2__S1, sub2__sub1__S1, sub3__S1, sub3__sub1__S1, sub3__sub2__S1, sub3__sub2__sub1__S1)
* 7 compartments (C, sub1__C, sub2__C, sub3__C, sub3__sub1__C, sub3__sub2__C, sub3__sub2__sub1__C)
The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial amount of species S1 | $5$ | constant |
| Initial amount of species sub1__S1 | $7$ | constant |
| Initial amount of species sub2__S1 | $9$ | constant |
| Initial amount of species sub2__sub1__S1 | $7$ | constant |
| Initial amount of species sub3__S1 | $11$ | constant |
| Initial amount of species sub3__sub1__S1 | $7$ | constant |
| Initial amount of species sub3__sub2__S1 | $9$ | constant |
| Initial amount of species sub3__sub2__sub1__S1 | $7$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'C' | $10$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'sub1__C' | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'sub2__C' | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'sub3__C' | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'sub3__sub1__C' | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'sub3__sub2__C' | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'sub3__sub2__sub1__C' | $1$ | constant |]

The species' initial quantities are given in terms of substance units to
make it easier to use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but
their symbols represent their values in concentration units where they
appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
