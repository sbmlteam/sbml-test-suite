synopsis:      A very simple reaction with stoichiometry changed by a rate rule.

Note:  This test is the L3 version of model 973.

Over the course of the simulation, the stoichiometry 'Xref' changes at a rate of 0.01/time, so the effective rate of synthesis increases as well, identically to the same model with k1 changing instead of Xref.  The Level 2 versions of this test create a new parameter 'parameterId_0' which functions identically to 'Xref' in the Level 3 version of the model.

The model contains:
* 1 species (X)
* 1 parameter (k1)
* 1 compartment (default_compartment)

There is one reaction:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| -> Xref X | $k1$ |]
Note:  the following stoichiometries are set separately:  Xref


There is one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
| Rate | Xref | $0.01$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial concentration of species X | $0$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter k1 | $1$ | variable |
| Initial volume of compartment 'default_compartment' | $1$ | constant |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
