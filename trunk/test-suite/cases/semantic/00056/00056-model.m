The model contains two compartments named "compartment" and "compartment1".
There are two species named S1 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" contains species S1.  Compartment "compartment1"
contains species S3.  The model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * compartment$  |
| S3 -> S1 | $k2 * (S3-S1) * compartment1$  |]

Both reactions occur between species within different compartments.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                 |$          1.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                 |$            0$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1                |$         0.75$ |second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2                |$         0.25$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment "compartment"  |$            1$ |litre                     |
|Volume of compartment "compartment"1 |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
