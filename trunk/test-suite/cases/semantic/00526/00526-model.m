The model contains one compartment called C.  There are two species called 
S1 and S2 and one parameter called k.  The model contains one 
reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $C * k * S1$  |]

Reaction $S1 -> S2$ defines one local parameter k.  Note that this
parameter has a scope local to the defining reaction.

The model contains one initialAssignment:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| Variable | Formula |
 | C | $k / 50$  |]

Note: SBML's InitialAssignment construct override any declared initial
values.  In this case the initial value declared for compartment C is
consistent with the value returned by the InitialAssignment.


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width 30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*  |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1        |$1$        |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2        |$1.5$      |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k        |$50$       |litre |
|Value of local parameter k  |$0.5$      |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C     |$1$      |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) they must be treated as concentrations where they appear in
expressions.
