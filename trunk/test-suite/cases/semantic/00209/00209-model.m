The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 2-dimensional.  Species S1, S2 and S3 are
declared to have only substance units.  The model contains two reactions
defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|      |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1              |$1.0 \x 10^-1$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2              |$2.0 \x 10^-1$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3              |$1.0 \x 10^-1$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1             |$           75$ |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2             |$           25$ |second^-1^ |
|Area of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |metre^2^                  |]

The species have been declared as having substance units only.  Thus, they
must be treated as amounts where they appear in expressions.
