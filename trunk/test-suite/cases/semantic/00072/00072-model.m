category:      Test
synopsis:      A simple reaction during which the species values are reset 
               by events which are subject to delays.

The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are two
species named S1 and S2 and one parameter named k1.  The model contains one
reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $k1 * S1 * compartment$  |]

The model contains two events defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| | *Trigger*    | *Delay* | *Assignments* |
 | Event1 | $S1 < 0.1$ | $1$   | $S1 = 1$ |
 | Event2 | $S2 > 0.5$ | $0.5$ | $S2 = 0$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$            1$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$            0$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$            1$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
