 In MathML, it is legal to have 3+ arguments to relational elements such as greater than.  This model checks to make sure interpreters notice the third argument, which changes the rate rule from 1 to 0.

The model contains:
* 1 parameter (x)

There is one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
| Rate | x | $piecewise(1, gt(2, 1, 2), 0)$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial value of parameter x | $3$ | variable |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
