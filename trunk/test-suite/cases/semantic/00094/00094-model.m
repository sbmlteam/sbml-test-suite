The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are four
species named S1, S2, S3 and S4 and three parameters named k1, k2 and k3.
The model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * compartment$  |
| S3 -> S1 | $k2 * S3 * compartment$  |]

The model contains two rules:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Assignment | S4 | $k3 * S1$  |
 | Rate       | S2 | $k2 * S3-k1 * S1$  |]

Note that in this case the initial value declared for species S4 is inconsistent
with the value calculated by the assignmentRule.  The calculated value should be used.  

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$   1 \x 10^-5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$ 1.5 \x 10^-5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$   1 \x 10^-5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4                |$            5$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$        0.015$ |second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$          0.5$ |second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k3               |$          1.5$ |dimensionless |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
