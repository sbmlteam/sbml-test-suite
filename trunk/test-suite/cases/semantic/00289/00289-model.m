The model contains two compartments named compartment and compartment1.
There are four species named S1, S2, S3 and S4 and three parameters named
k1, k2 and k3.  Compartment "compartment" contains species S1 and S2.
Compartment "compartment"1 contains species S3 and S4.  The model contains
two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S2  +  S2 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * compartment$  |
| S2 -> S3         | $k2 * (S2-S3) * compartment1$  |]

The first reaction occurs entirely in compartment, whereas the second reaction
occurs between a species in compartment and a species in compartment1.

The model contains one rule which assigns value to species S4:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Assignment | S4 | $k3 * S3$  |]

In this case the initial value declared for species S4 is inconsistent with
that calculated by the assignmentRule; the calculated value should be used.
Note that since this assignmentRule must always remain true, it should be
considered during simulation.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                 |$          1.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                 |$          1.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                 |$            0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4                 |$          1.0$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1                |$         0.75$ |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2                |$         0.25$ |second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2                |$         0.25$ |dimensionless |
|Volume of compartment "compartment"  |$            1$ |litre                     |
|Volume of compartment "compartment"1 |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
