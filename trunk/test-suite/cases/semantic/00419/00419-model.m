The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three species
called S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters called k1 and k2.  Compartment C is
0-dimensional.  The model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3$     |]

The model contains one event that assigns a value to species S2:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| | *Trigger*  | *Delay* | *Assignments* |
 | Event1                      | $S1 < 0.7$ | $0.5$   | $S2 = 1.25$   |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|      |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1  |$1.0$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2  |$2.0$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3  |$1.0$  |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1 |$0.8$           |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2 |$0.2$           |second^-1^                |]

In this example the compartment has its spatialDimensions attribute set to
zero; i.e., it represents a point and therefore cannot have size or units.
The species values must be treated as amounts and not concentrations.
