The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There is one
species named S1.  The model does not contain any reactions.
  
The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
| assignmentRule | S1 | $3 + 4$  |]

In the case there is no value attributed to the species by the model
definition and thus the value must be calculated by the rule.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*         |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$   undeclared$ | mole                      |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ | litre                     |]
				     
Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
