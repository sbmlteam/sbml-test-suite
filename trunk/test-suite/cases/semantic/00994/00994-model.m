Variable stoichiometry:  the stoichiometry is literally 'time'.

The equivalent model using Level 3 constructs is present as 
test 1109.

The model contains:
* 1 species (X)
* 1 parameter (k1)
* 1 compartment (default_compartment)

There is one reaction:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| -> Xref X | $k1$ |]
Note:  the following stoichiometries are set separately:  Xref


There is one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
| Assignment | Xref | $time$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial concentration of species X | $1$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter k1 | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'default_compartment' | $1$ | constant |]
