The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are two
species called S1 and S2 and two parameters called k1 and k2.  The model
contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin-left:5em}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $k1 * S1 * compartment$  |
| S2 -> S1 | $k2 * S2 * compartment$  |]

The value of k2 is zero, which means the reverse reaction should occur at
zero rate (i.e., not at all).

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin-left:5em}|       |*Value*          |*Units*        |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.5 \x 10^-3$  |mole           |
|Initial amount of S2                |$0$           |mole           |
|Value of parameter k1               |$1$              |second^-1^     |
|Value of parameter k2               |$0$              |second^-1^     |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$1$              |litre          |]

The species' values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
