 This model contains a single parameter x changing at a constant rate, and a second parameter y with a continually-changing delay for an assignment rule:  it takes the value of x at time/2 ago.  Effectively, this means that y changes at half the rate of x.

The model contains:
* 2 parameters (x, y)
* 1 compartment (default_compartment)

There are 2 rules:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
| Rate | x | $1$ |
| Assignment | y | $delay(x, time / 2)$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial value of parameter x | $1$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter y | $delay(x, time / 2)$ | variable |
| Initial volume of compartment 'default_compartment' | $1$ | constant |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
