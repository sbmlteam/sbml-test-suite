An event watches to see when X goes above 5.  When it does, the stoichiometry of the reaction producing X jumps to 3, increasing X production.

The model contains:
* 1 species (X)
* 1 parameter (k1)
* 1 compartment (default_compartment)

There is one reaction:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| -> Xref X | $k1$ |]
Note:  the following stoichiometries are set separately:  Xref


There is one event:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Event*  |  *Trigger*  | *Event Assignments* |
| _E0 | $X &geq; 5$ | $Xref = 3$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial concentration of species X | $0$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter k1 | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'default_compartment' | $1$ | constant |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
