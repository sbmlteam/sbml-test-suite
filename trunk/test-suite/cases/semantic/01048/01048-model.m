Note:  This test is a copy of model 848, with the products and reactants reversed, and a negative kinetic law.  This gives the same results, but during the simulation, the kinetic law actually goes negative (a requirement for reversibe reactions).  The reaction listed below is therfore equivalent to the one in the file, but reversed from it.

The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three species
called S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters called k1 and k2.  The model
contains one reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 <-> S2 | $(kf * S1 - kr * S2) * C$  |]

The model contains one event that assigns values to species S1:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| | *Trigger*   | *Delay* | *Assignments* |
 | Event1                      | $S1 < 0.75$ | $1$     | $S2 = 1.5$    |]
 
The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value* |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1          |$1.0$   |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2         |$2.0$   |mole                      |
|Value of parameter kf         |$0.9$  |second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter kr         |$0.075$  |second^-1^                |
|Volume of compartment C       |$1$     |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
