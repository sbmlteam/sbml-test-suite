The model contains one varying compartment called c and one constant
parameter called k1.  (Note that indeed c is a compartment and not 
species in this model.)

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Rate                                 | c           | $-c * k1$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*         |*Units*    |
|Size of compartment c         |$            5$ |litre        |
|Value of parameter k1         |$            1$ |second^-1^ |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
