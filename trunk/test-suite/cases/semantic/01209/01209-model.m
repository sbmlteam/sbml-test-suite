 In MathML, it is legal to have 3+ arguments to relational elements such as less than.  This model checks to make sure interpreters notice the third argument, which changes the result of the 'piecewise' test.

The model contains:
* 1 parameter (x)
The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial value of parameter x | $piecewise(1, lt(1, 2, 1), 3)$ | constant |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
