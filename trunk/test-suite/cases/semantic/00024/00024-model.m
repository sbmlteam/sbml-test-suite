The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are four
species named S1, S2, S3 and S4 and four parameters named k1, k2, k3 and
k4.  Species S3 is labeled a SBML boundary condition and is also labeled
constant.  The model contains four reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2    | $k1 * S1 * compartment$     |
| S2 -> S1    | $k2 * S2 * compartment$     |
| S2 -> S3 + S4 | $k3 * S2 * compartment$     |
| S3 + S4 -> S2 | $k4 * S3 * S4 * compartment$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                       |
|Initial amount of S2                |$2.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                       |
|Initial amount of S3                |$0$              |mole                       |
|Initial amount of S4                |$0$              |mole                       |
|Value of parameter k1               |$0.75$           |second^-1^                 |
|Value of parameter k2               |$0.25$           |second^-1^                 |
|Value of parameter k3               |$0.4$           |second^-1^                 |
|Value of parameter k4               |$0.1$            |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^  |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$1$              |litre                      |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
