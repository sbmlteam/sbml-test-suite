The model contains one compartment called "default_compartment".  There are two
species called S1 and S2. 


 The model contains one parameter (x) that oscillates (from the 'sin' function), and a second parameter (y) that echoes the first after a 0.2 second delay.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
