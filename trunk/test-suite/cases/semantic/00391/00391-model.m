Note:  earlier versions of the test suite contained a 3.1 version of this test.
That model was moved to its own test, because it did not have the 'StoichiometryMath'
component.

The model contains one compartment called C.  There are four species called
S1, S2, S3 and S4 and two parameters called k1 and k2.  The model contains
two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> (4 * p1)S3 + S4 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * C$  |
| 2S3 + S4 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * S4 * C$  |]

The model contains two events that assign values to species S1 and S4:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| | *Trigger*            | *Delay* | *Assignments* |
 | Event1                      | $S4 > S2$            | $-$     | $S1 -> 2 \x 10^-4$    |]
 | Event2                      | $S3 > 2.5 \x 10^-4$ | $-$     | $S4 -> 1 \x 10^-4$    |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1          |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                       |
|Initial amount of S2          |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                       |
|Initial amount of S3          |$2.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                       |
|Initial amount of S4          |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                       |
|Value of parameter k1         |$0.75 \x 10^4$  |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^  |
|Value of parameter k2         |$0.25 \x 10^4$  |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^  |
|Value of parameter p1         |$          0.5$  |dimensionless              |
|Volume of compartment C       |$1$              |litre                      |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
