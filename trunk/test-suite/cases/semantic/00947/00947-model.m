Test of an event changing the size of a compartment.

The model contains:
* 1 species (S1)
* 1 parameter (k1)
* 1 compartment (C)

There is one reaction:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| -> S1 | $C * k1 / S1$ |]


The model contains one event that assigns a value to the compartment C:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Event*  |  *Trigger*  | *Event Assignments* |
| event1 | $S1 > 2.1$ | $C = 10$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial amount of species S1 | $1$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter k1 | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'C' | $1$ | variable |]

The species' initial quantities are given in terms of substance units to
make it easier to use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but
their symbols represent their values in concentration units where they
appear in expressions.
