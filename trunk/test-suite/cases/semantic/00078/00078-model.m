The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.  The model
contains one reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $compartment * k2 * S$  |]

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Assignment | S3 | $multiply(k1, S1)$  |]

The model contains one functionDefinition defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Id*  |  *Arguments*  |  *Formula*  |
 | multiply | x, y | $x * y$ |]

Note that in this case the initial value of the species S3 is not explicitly
declared and must be calculated by the AssignmentRule. 

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$            1$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$          0.5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$   undeclared$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$          1.5$ |dimensionless |
|Value of parameter k2               |$            5$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$             $ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
