The 'fast' reaction should go to completion instantly, converting all of A to B.  Then B converts to C normally.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin-left:5em}| |*Value*       |
|Value of species A       |$1$          |
|Value of species B       |$0$          |
|Value of species C       |$0$          |]
