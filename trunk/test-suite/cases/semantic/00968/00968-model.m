synopsis:      A very simple reaction with stoichiometry set by an initialAssignment.

Note:  earlier versions of the test suite contained a 3.1 version of this test.
That model was moved to its own test, because it did not have the 'StoichiometryMath'
component.

The speciesReference ('Xref') is set with stoichiometryMath in the L2 models.  No 'stoichiometry' value is provided in the speciesReference in the reaction itself.

The model contains:
* 1 species (X)
* 1 parameter (k1)
* 1 compartment (default_compartment)

There is one reaction:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| -> Xref X | $k1$ |]
Note:  the following stoichiometries are set separately:  Xref

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial amount of species X | $0$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter k1 | $1$ | constant |
| Initial volume of compartment 'default_compartment' | $1$ | constant |]

The species' initial quantities are given in terms of substance units to
make it easier to use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but
their symbols represent their values in concentration units where they
appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
