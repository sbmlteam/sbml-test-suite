The model contains one varying compartment called C.  There are two
species called S1 and S2 and two parameters called k1 and p1.  The model
contains one reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $k1 * S1 * C$  |]

The model contains one rule which defines the rate at which the volume of
the compartment is changing:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Rate | C | $-p1 * C$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*         |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$          1.5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$            0$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$          0.9$ |second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter p1               |$          0.1$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
