The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three
species called S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters called k1 and k2.  The model
contains one reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $C * k2 * S1$  |]

The model contains one rule which assigns value to species S3:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Assignment | S3 | $k1 * S2$  |]

In this case the initial value declared for species S3 is consistent with
the value calculated by the assignmentRule.  Note that since this
assignmentRule must always remain true, it should be considered during
simulation.

The model contains one event that assigns a value to species S2:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| | *Trigger*    | *Delay* | *Assignments* |
 | Event1 | $S1 < 0.25$ | $-$   | $S2 = 1$    |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*         |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$            1$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$            0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$        0.375$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$         0.75$ |dimensionless |
|Value of parameter k2               |$            5$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C |$            0.79$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
