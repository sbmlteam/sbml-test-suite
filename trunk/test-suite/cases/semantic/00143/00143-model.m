The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.  The model
contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * compartment$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * compartment$  |]

The model contains one rule which assigns value to compartment "compartment":

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Assignment | compartment | $1$  |]

In this case the initial value declared for compartment "compartment" is
inconsistent with the value calculated by the assignmentRule.  The
calculated value should be used.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$    1 \x 10^-5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$ 1.5 \x 10^-5$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$   1 \x 10^-5$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$  1.5 \x 10^5$ |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$           50$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$            5$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
