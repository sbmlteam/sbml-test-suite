The model contains one varying compartment called c.  (Note that 
indeed c is a compartment and not species in this model.)

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*         |
 | Rate                                 | c           | $0.5 * c$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*         |*Units*  |
|Size of compartment c         |$1.5 \x 10^-2$ |litre        |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
