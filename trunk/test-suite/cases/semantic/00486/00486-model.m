The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three species called 
S1, S2 and S3 and three parameters called k1, k2 and p1.  Compartment C is 
1-dimensional.  The model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * C$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * C$  |]

The model contains one initialAssignment:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| Variable | Formula |
 | C | $p1 * 2$  |]

Note: SBML's InitialAssignment construct override any declared initial
values.  In this case the initial value declared for compartment C is
consistent with the value returned by the InitialAssignment.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*       |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1        |$1.0$           |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2        |$2.0$           |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3        |$1.0$           |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1       |$3.5$           |metre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2       |$1.5$           |second^-1^                |
|Value of parameter p1       |$0.5$           |metre                |
|Length of compartment C     |$1$             |metre                  |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) they must be treated as concentrations where they appear in
expressions.
