The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are four
species named S1, S2, S3 and S4 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 2-dimensional.  All four species are declared
to have only substance units.  The model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 + S4 | $k1 * S1 * S2$  |
| S3 + S4 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * S4$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|      |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1              |$1.0 \x 10^-3$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2              |$1.5 \x 10^-3$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3              |$2.0 \x 10^-3$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4              |$1.0 \x 10^-3$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1             |$ 7.5 \x 10^3$ |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2             |$0.25 \x 10^3$ |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Area of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |metre^2^                  |]

The species have been declared as having substance units only.  Thus, they 
must be treated as amounts where they appear in expressions.
