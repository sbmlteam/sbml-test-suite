1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

The SBML Test Suite consists of (1) a collection of valid SBML models
each with representative, simulated time course data; (2) a testing
framework for running software tools through the suite; and (3) basic
documentation on the test cases and the use of the suite.


----------------
2. SAMPLE MODELS
----------------

For further testing and illustration purposes, this suite also
contains a selection of SBML models drawn from different sources such
as the SBML specification and different model repositories.  You will
find these in the subdirectory "extras/sample-models".


----------
3. HISTORY
----------

The current SBML Test Suite is based on earlier work by Andrew Finney
on the "SBML Semantic Test Suite".
