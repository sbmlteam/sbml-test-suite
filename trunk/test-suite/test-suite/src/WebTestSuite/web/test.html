                        In systems biology, one challenge to establishing a lingua franca for computational models is the difficulty of ensuring correct interpretation of SBML by different software applications. Although it is essential to have clear language specification documents in which the possibility of misinterpretation has been reduced as much as possible, it is extremely difficult to write specification documents that anticipate the different questionsthat different developers, coming from different backgrounds, may make. Moreover, there are no effective criteria for "specification clarity" -- clarity is in the eye of the beholder, so to speak. Software developers end up being the interpreters of the documents and having to make judgments about their meaning.

                        In short, in a field as complex as computational modeling of biological phenomena, there is too much room for human error and misinterpretation. What is needed are operational tests which give unambiguous results demonstrating correct interpretations while pointing to the errors when the interpretations are incorrect. We are dealing with software, we should make our intentions concrete and capture them in software.

                        <b>The Solution is the SBML Test Suite</b>
                        <br><br>
                        It consists of (1) a collection of valid SBML models each
                        with representative, simulated time course data; (2) a testing framework for running software tools through the suite; and (3) basic documentation on the test cases and the use of the suite.

                <tr bgcolor="#c8d8f8" >
                    <td valign=top>
                        The first step in using the online test suite is to download the cases you wish to test. Download all cases or select the specific cases you would like to test for.

                        <A href="/test_suite/web/selecttests.html">Download test cases</A>
                    </td>
                    <td valign=top>
                    The second step is to upload your results for the test cases and view the summary of the compaison of your results with known results.
