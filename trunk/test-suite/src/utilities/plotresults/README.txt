This is a simple program for plotting the results of a semantic case
simulation.  It produces an HTML file that uses JavaScript libraries
to plot the results.

Synopsis:
          plotresults.py -d XXXXX-results.csv -o XXXXX-plot.html

The input file given by the -d argument is assumed be a
comma-separated value file.  The input file should normally have a
name of the form XXXXX-results.csv.

To find out about other options, run

          plotresults.py --help
