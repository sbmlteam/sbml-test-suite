USAGE_TEXT="Usage: `basename $0`  MAPFILE

This program assumes it is being run from the root of the SBML Test Suite
source tree.  It decends into the 'cases/semantic' subdirectory and looks
through every case model definition file, searching for the presence of
specific tags.  It then writes to MAPFILE, on the first line by itself, the
highest numbered case number, followed on each subsequent line by a case
number and all the component tags, test tags and level tags contained in the
case's model definition file.  The result looks like

00900
00001 Compartment Species Reaction Parameter InitialAmount 1.2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 
00002 Compartment Species Reaction Parameter InitialAmount 1.2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 
....

and so on.  The number of lines in the file equals the number of test cases.
