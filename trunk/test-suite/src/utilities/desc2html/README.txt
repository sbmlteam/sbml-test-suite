"desc2html.sh" is a simple program for pulling out descriptions from
SBML Test Suite test case definition files (which are Mathematica .m
files) and generating HTML versions of the descriptions.  It uses a
wiki markup language called "Wiky" (the source code for which is
provided in <test-suite>/src/imported/wiky) and the Mozilla Rhino
version 1.6 JavaScript interpreter (the source code for which is
provided in <test-suite>/src/imported/rhino).

Synopsis:
          desc2html.sh XXXXX-model.m XXXXX-model.html

The detailed usage instructions for the program are provided at the
beginning of the file desc2html.sh.
