This directory contains the unmodified Apache Jakarta Standard Tag
Library version 1.1, obtained from http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/.
The Jakarta Taglibs library provides utilities for developing and
using custom JSP tag libraries.

The Online SBML Test Suite uses this library in its JSP-based
interface.  The files "lib/jstl.jar" and "lib/standard.jar" are copied
to the directory /var/lib/tomcat5/webapps/test_suite/WEB-INF/lib/ in
the installation of the Online SBML Test Suite.

The Jakarta Standard Tag Library is Copyright 2001-2008 by The Apache
Software Foundation.  The licensing terms are described in the file
"LICENSE" included in this directory.
