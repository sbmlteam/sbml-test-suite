@brief   Documentation for Wiky
@author  Michael Hucka

This directory contains copies of certain web pages for Wiky website
as they appeared circa Feb. 2008, http://goessner.net/articles/wiky/.
Wiky was written by Stefan Goessner.

The documentation for Wiky is unfortunately sparse, and the web pages
were all that I could find.  I provide copies here as snapshots and
records in case the Wiky website ever disappears.

Credit for writing Wiky and the documentation belongs entirely to
Stefan Goessner.
