Filters
-------

It is often convenient to be able to limit the currently-displayed results to a chosen subset.  The SBML Test Runner's filter facility can be invoked from the menubar or the toolbar icon.

The Filter panel lets you select a subset based on either case numbers and/or tags.  For either one, you can chose to select by including cases (by numbers and/or tags) and/or excluding cases (again by numbers and/or tags).  When both inclusions are exclusions are applied, inclusions are processed first, followed by exclusions.  When both case numbers and tags are specified, numbers are processed first, followed by tags.

When a filter is in effect, the main window will display a notice bar near the top to alert you that the results shown are not the entire set.  The case numbers listed in the left-hand panel of the main window will only include the selected cases; likewise, the cases shown in the result map will also be limited to just those cases selected by the filter.

To disable the filter, clear all the filter criteria in the filter dialog.
