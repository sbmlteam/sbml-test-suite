SBML Test Suite Test Runner NEWS  -- History of user-visible changes

====================================================================
Version 3.0.0 (2013-06-06)
====================================================================

Final release of 3.0.0.  The following are additional changes not
logged in the notes for beta versions up to this point.

New features:

* The position and size of the main window and the results map are now
  remembered across invocations of the Test Runner.

* The results map now displays an explanation of the result codes, in
  the information box at the bottom, when the mouse is moved over a
  result in the map.

* The runner now provides a way to view output that might have been
  produced by the wrapper on the standard output and standard error
  streams.  There are menu options in the menu bar and the pop-up
  menus.

* There is a now a help system.  Contents are sparse at the moment,
  but at least there's something...

Changes: 

* The test runner will now delete output results files before invoking
  the wrapper on each test case.  If the deletion fails, it reports an
  error (as a "black" color in the results map).  This is to help
  prevent situations in which an output file is locked by another
  process (e.g., open in an Excel window on Windows) and the wrapper
  does not return an error value when it tries to write to the file;
  in that situation, the Test Runner would have no way of knowing that
  a problem occurred.  (If the wrapper could be counted on to return
  an error, then there wouldn't be a potential problem, but not all
  wrappers behave as expected.)  This way, by attempting to delete the
  file first, the Test Runner can tell the user something is wrong.

* The system previously didn't report the case of when a results file
  existed but was unreadable or had a parse error.  The system now
  catches this and communicates the errors up to the GUI.

* The order of OK/Save and Cancel buttons in the dialogs has been made
  consistent across the different dialogs.

* There are now new menu items to sync/refresh selected results from
  their files, instead of (previously) having only the option to sync
  all results.

* The system no longer selects any cases when you first start up.
  Instead, things are left blank, and a message is printed in the
  description area about "no case selected" to give the user a clue
  about why they're seeing blanks.

* Implemented graphing of FBC results.  The current implementation is
  kind of simplistic and uses bar graphs, but hopefully will be good
  enough for now.

* Commented out the SED-ML menu options because they're currently
  unimplemented and may not be for a while yet.

* Fixed: changing the SBML Level & Version using the pull-down menu in
  the main window didn't refresh the case list or stop a running
  simulation.

Released 6 June 2013.

Version 3.0.0beta2 (2013-05-21)
====================================================================

Changes to the SBML Test Runner:Changes to the SBML Test Runner:

* Upon a first-time start-up, the preferences/wrapper definition panel
  left the wrapper fields editable even if the user did not click on
  "Add".  This made was a confusing situation.  It now properly
  disables the fields.

* Released 21 May 2013.


====================================================================
Version 3.0.0beta1 (2013-05-17)
====================================================================

* This is the initial public release of the completely rewritten,
  third generation of the SBML Test Runner.

* This is a beta test release, and while it is believed to function
  correctly, it is likely that problems will be discovered in
  different user environments.  PLEASE REPORT ANY PROBLEMS to
  sbml-team@caltech.edu.

* Released 17 May 2013.
