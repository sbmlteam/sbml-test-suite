<h2 id="definingwrappers">Defining wrappers</h2>

<p>The execution of tests involves the use of &#8220;wrapper&#8221; programs that act
as interfaces between the SBML Test Runner and the application being
tested. The SBML Test Runner invokes this &#8220;wrapper&#8221; for each test
case in the suite, passing command-line arguments to the wrapper to
indicate such things as which case to run and where to find the files.
It is the responsibility of the wrapper to invoke the application to
run the case in whatever fashion is appropriate for that application.
A wrapper can be simple (e.g., a shell script) or a small program all
on its own, depending on the application being tested. (Some
applications may not need a wrapper at all, if they can understand the
necessary command line arguments directly and produce output in the
format needed by the SBML Test Runner.)</p>

<p>When you first start the Runner, you will not have any wrapper
configurations defined. The Runner will open a Preferences panel to
let you define one or more wrapper configurations.</p>

<p>Each wrapper configuration has the following fields:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>a name</p></li>
<li><p>the path to the wrapper program on your computer</p></li>
<li><p>the path to a directory where the Runner will find the application&#8217;s
 output from running each test case</p></li>
<li><p>a list of component or test tags that the application is known to be
 unable to understand</p></li>
<li><p>command-line arguments that should be passed to the wrapper</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the command-line arguments given to the wrapper, the following
substitution codes can be used. Their values will be substituted at
run-time whenever the wrapper is invoked:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code>%d</code></td><td>the path to the directory containing all the test cases</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>%n</code></td><td>the current test case number (in the form of 5 digits)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>%o</code></td><td>the directory where the output will be written (same as #3 above)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>%l</code></td><td>the SBML Level of the test case</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>%v</code></td><td>the SBML Version within the Level of the test case</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Each test case consists of an SBML file and a settings file. The files
are located in the directory named <code>%d/%n</code>. The SBML file for the test
model is named <code>%n-sbml-l%lv%v.xml</code>. (Example: <code>00123-sbml-l2v3.xml</code>.)
The settings file is named <code>%n-settings.txt</code> in the same directory.
The wrapper must be instructed to write out the results into a file
named <code>%o/%n.csv</code> so that the SBML Test Runner can find it.</p>

<p>The definition of a wrapper also includes 3 options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Pseudo-wrapper to view test cases only</em>: When set, this option
 defines a wrapper as non-executable and disables some of the fields
 in the preferences panel. Use this option to define a wrapper for
 viewing existing results (e.g., results created in some other
 fashion than through the SBML Test Runner). The wrapper definition
 allows you to define the directory where the results will be found,
 as well as unsupported tags, but not program path or arguments.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wrapper can handle any SBML Level/Version</em>: Some applications may
 not be able to accept any SBML Level and Version.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wrapper can be run in parallel</em>: The Runner can execute tasks in
 parallel, but it must be informed whether multiple instances of a
 wrapper or application can be invoked simultaneously. Use this
 flag to indicate that multiple copies of the wrapper can be started
 simultaneously. Do <em>not</em> enable this option if the wrapper (or
 application) writes to the same file (e.g., a single log file),
 locks a single resource, or does something else that would result
 in non-deterministic behavior if multiple copies of the wrapper or
 application are started simultaneously. If you use a shell script,
 also make sure that the script does not return before the
 application you&#8217;re testing returns a result. (In other words, do
 not have the shell script start the application as a background
 process; make sure the script terminates only when the application
 itself terminates.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can define multiple wrappers, but only one will be executed during
any given test run. (You will be able to choose it from a pull-down
menu in the main window of the SBML Test Runner.)</p>
