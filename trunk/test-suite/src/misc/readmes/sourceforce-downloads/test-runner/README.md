**The SBML Test Suite â€“ Test Runner**
======================================================================

The **SBML Test Runner** is a platform-independent application (the SBML Test Runner) runnable on almost any computer.  It allows a user to drive a software application to run each of the tests in the SBML Test Suite's _semantic_ tests, and evaluate the results based on whether they are correct or incorrect.

_**NOTICE**_: **The SBML Test Runner has not yet been updated for the 3.2.0 release of the SBML Test Suite test cases.**  We will announce when it is available.  In the meantime, you can use the [test cases](../case-archives) directly and manually compare the test results against the expected results.
