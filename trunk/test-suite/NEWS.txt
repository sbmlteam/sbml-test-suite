          Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Test Suite
               NEWS -- history of user-visible changes

=== Version 1.2 ===

* We have removed the Level 1 version 1 files from this set, because
  L1v1 is officially deprecated.  Users are encouraged to examine 
  L1v2 or better yet, Level 2.


=== Version 1.1 ===

* The KEGG translated files are no longer included with the test-suite
  distribution.  They can be obtained separately from the following site:

  http://systems-biology.org/001/


=== Version 1.0.1 ===

* The following SBML Level 2 version 1 errata have been corrected in
  sbml-files/sbml-l2v1/from-spec:

    - l2v1-2D-compartments.xml: the "JO" in the MathML should really
      be a "J0" (the numeral zero, no the letter 'oh').

    - l2v1-boundary.xml: the one rule in listOfRules should not use
      <apply> ... </apply>; these tags should be omitted. Thanks to
      Bruce Shapiro for catching this.

    - l2v1-delay.xml: The definitionURL for the csymbol delay should
      be http://www.sbml.org/sbml/symbols/delay, not
      http://www.sbml.org/symbols/delay (the incorrect form has "sbml"
      omitted). Thanks to Marc Vass for catching this.

    - l2v1-mc-ode.xml: the MathML in the two rateRule definitions
      should not use <apply> ... </apply>; these tags should be
      omitted. Thanks to Bruce Shapiro for catching this.

* Released  7 August 2003




=== Version 1.0.0 ===

* Initial release, 29 June 2003.
