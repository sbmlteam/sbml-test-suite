=== Current svn version ===

* New features

  - Cases where an initial value is reassigned by math within the
    model have been tagged with an 'InitialValueReassigned' tag.

  - New cases that involve just a non-varying parameter whose value
    is set by initialAssignment or assignmentRule have been added.
  
  - New cases that involve only a compartment that is varying have
    been added.
    
  - All models that can be encoded in SBML L3V1 core (in accordance
    with the Release 1 Candidate specification) have an L3 sbml file.
    
* Bug fixes

  - Tracker issue #2961844.
    The data for case 00873 was inaccurate.  The data now reflects
    results verified with VCell and iBioSim.

  - Tracker issue #2961843.
    The data for case 00874 was inaccurate.  The data now reflects
    results verified with VCell and iBioSim.

  - Tracker issue #2941625.
    The data for this case raised concerns.  Testing with Copasi,
    RoadRunner and iBioSim showed the results to be slightly
    inaccurate.  These have been changed.  Thanks to Chris Myers
    for reporting this.

  - Tracker issue #2941618.
    The order of data did not match the order in the sbml files.
    This has been fixed.  Thanks to Chris Myers for reporting this.	       

=== Version 2.0.0 alpha 4 (test-cases only release 2010-01-17) ===

* Corrections to disputed results involving event test cases.

* Corrections to misordering of data in results file for some cases
  involving algebraic rules.  (Actual results were correct, but the
  data and labels were misordered.)

* Minor changes to SVN organization of test files and corresponding
  changes to the Makefile; however, the changes do not come through in
  the test cases zip archive.


=== Version 2.0.0 alpha 3 (limited release 2008-08-27) ===

* Fixed a problem in the Standalone Application in unpackaging the
  archive of test cases.


=== Version 2.0.0 alpha 1 (limited release 2008-08-22) ===

* We redesigned and reimplemented the SBML Test Suite from the ground
  up.  The new system features a very large corpus of 900 carefully
  hand-crafted models, a new standalone test runner, and a web-based
  test runner available at http://sbml.org/Facilities/.

  All test cases have component tags indicating which SBML components
  are present in the model.  Basic models have either Compartment,
  Species and Reaction or Parameter and RateRule.  Additional
  complexity is added to the models by including other components:
  FunctionDefinition, InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule,
  AlgebraicRule, RateRule (in cases where Reactions are used),
  EventNoDelay and EventWithDelay.  At the time of this release, the
  test suite contains models with the basic components and up to two
  further components, with approximately 100 cases for each component.
  More complexity can be introduced with the addition of further
  components within a given model.

  At present UnitDefinition and Constraint are not supported.
  
  Each test case lists the test tags related to the SBML feature being
  tested.  Again, these start with the basic cases where the test tag
  is InitialAmount (in cases where there are Reactions) and
  NonConstantParameter (in rules based models).  Additional tags are
  added to increase the complexity and in some cases test the
  interaction between different features.  At present there are up to
  4 test tags on models within the Test Suite.
  
  All the test tags in the Tags.txt file have some coverage (an
  average of 50 cases per tag) WITH THE EXCEPTION of CSymbolDelay,
  Units, MassUnits.  Some tags have only a few related test cases eg
  FastReaction, MultiCompartment; this is mainly due to the lack of
  simulators supporting these and thus difficulty in generating and
  verifying test data.
  
  The data has in most cases been generated by MathSBML and verified
  with SBMLToolbox.  VCell and SBToolbox2 have been used for a few
  cases.  7% of cases have analytical solutions derived using the
  Maple symbolic engine via MATLAB.

=== Version 1.4 (2007-06-24, never released publicly) ===

* Merged the previous test suite (which in reality consisted of
  nothing more than sample models) with a slightly reorganized version
  of the "SBML Semantic Test Suite", with the intention of renaming
  the semantic test suit as the SBML Test Suite and redesigning
  everything for release 3.0.  The reorganization and additional
  CVS-related work was done by Sarah Keating and Michael Hucka.

  A beta test version of the "SBML Semantic Test Suite" in the days of
  SBML Level 2 Version 1 was written principally by Andrew Finney,
  (then at the University of Hertfordshire, UK) and released in
  October 2004.  The suite consisted of a set of SBML models each with
  correct simulation output.  The test suite came with automation
  scripts allowing a simulator to be systematically tested against the
  test suite.  The automation scripts were designed to be portable and
  run on Windows, Unix, and Unix-like platforms.  In its beta version,
  the test suite was reasonably comprehensive covering most SBML Level
  2 Version 1 constructs: all the MathML functions and operators, all
  types of rules, all possible configurations of reactions and
  different configurations of local and global parameters.
  
  A substantial reorganization and reconstruction was begun in 2007 as
  part of NIH/NIGMS grant #GM077671.  We expect virtually everything in
  the suite to be changed and improved.
  
* The contents of the previous directory "sample-models" have been
  moved to "extras/sample-models".

* "extras/sample-models" now also contains samples from SBML Level 2
  Versions 2 and 3.


=== Version 1.3 ===

Released 7 September 2004.

* If you are getting this via CVS, make sure to use the -P (prune)
  option to the cvs update command, so that you don't get delete
  directories and files.  The current release contains only one
  subdirectory, "sample-models".

* We now have CVS commit auto-notification via email.  Visit the page
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sbml-cvs-tstsuite to
  subscribe to notifications.  This is a very good idea if you get
  this test suite via CVS.

* Removed the SBML and MathML schema files from the distribution.
  Interested users should obtain them from the master locations.
  Keeping a separate copy in this test suite was a maintenance
  liability, because they would surely fall out of date eventually.

* Reinstated the SBML Level 1 Version 1 files except for the files
  converted from KEGG (i.e., the directory sbml-l1v1/from-kegg).
  After some discussions, we concluded that there may still be some
  value in providing sample models in L1v1 format for developers who
  need to test their software's backward compatibility.


=== Version 1.2 ===

* We have removed the Level 1 Version 1 files from this set, because
  L1v1 is officially deprecated.  Users are encouraged to examine L1v2
  or better yet, Level 2.


=== Version 1.1 ===

* The KEGG translated files are no longer included with the test-suite
  distribution.  They can be obtained separately from the following site:

  http://systems-biology.org/001/


=== Version 1.0.1 ===

* The following SBML Level 2 version 1 errata have been corrected in
  sbml-files/sbml-l2v1/from-spec:

    - l2v1-2D-compartments.xml: the "JO" in the MathML should really
      be a "J0" (the numeral zero, no the letter 'oh').

    - l2v1-boundary.xml: the one rule in listOfRules should not use
      <apply> ... </apply>; these tags should be omitted. Thanks to
      Bruce Shapiro for catching this.

    - l2v1-delay.xml: The definitionURL for the csymbol delay should
      be http://www.sbml.org/sbml/symbols/delay, not
      http://www.sbml.org/symbols/delay (the incorrect form has "sbml"
      omitted). Thanks to Marc Vass for catching this.

    - l2v1-mc-ode.xml: the MathML in the two rateRule definitions
      should not use <apply> ... </apply>; these tags should be
      omitted. Thanks to Bruce Shapiro for catching this.

* Released  7 August 2003


=== Version 1.0.0 ===

* Initial release, 29 June 2003.
