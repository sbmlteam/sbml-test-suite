	The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Test Suite
	       NEWS -- history of user-visible changes


=== Version 1.4 (2007-06-24, never released publicly) ===

* Merged the previous test suite (which in reality consisted of
  nothing more than sample models) with a slightly reorganized version
  of the "SBML Semantic Test Suite", with the intention of renaming
  the semantic test suit as the SBML Test Suite and redesigning
  everything for release 3.0.  The reorganization and additional
  CVS-related work was done by Sarah Keating and Michael Hucka.

  A beta test version of the "SBML Semantic Test Suite" in the days of
  SBML Level 2 Version 1 was written principally by Andrew Finney,
  (then at the University of Hertfordshire, UK) and released in
  October 2004.  The suite consisted of a set of SBML models each with
  correct simulation output.  The test suite came with automation
  scripts allowing a simulator to be systematically tested against the
  test suite.  The automation scripts were designed to be portable and
  run on Windows, Unix, and Unix-like platforms.  In its beta version,
  the test suite was reasonably comprehensive covering most SBML Level
  2 Version 1 constructs: all the MathML functions and operators, all
  types of rules, all possible configurations of reactions and
  different configurations of local and global parameters.
  
  A substantial reorganization and reconstruction was begun in 2007 as
  part of NIH/NIGMS grant #GM077671.  We expect virtually everything in
  the suite to be changed and improved.
  
* The contents of the previous directory "sample-models" have been
  moved to "extras/sample-models".

* "extras/sample-models" now also contains samples from SBML Level 2
  Versions 2 and 3.


=== Version 1.3 ===

Released 7 September 2004.

* If you are getting this via CVS, make sure to use the -P (prune)
  option to the cvs update command, so that you don't get delete
  directories and files.  The current release contains only one
  subdirectory, "sample-models".

* We now have CVS commit auto-notification via email.  Visit the page
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sbml-cvs-tstsuite to
  subscribe to notifications.  This is a very good idea if you get
  this test suite via CVS.

* Removed the SBML and MathML schema files from the distribution.
  Interested users should obtain them from the master locations.
  Keeping a separate copy in this test suite was a maintenance
  liability, because they would surely fall out of date eventually.

* Reinstated the SBML Level 1 Version 1 files except for the files
  converted from KEGG (i.e., the directory sbml-l1v1/from-kegg).
  After some discussions, we concluded that there may still be some
  value in providing sample models in L1v1 format for developers who
  need to test their software's backward compatibility.


=== Version 1.2 ===

* We have removed the Level 1 Version 1 files from this set, because
  L1v1 is officially deprecated.  Users are encouraged to examine L1v2
  or better yet, Level 2.


=== Version 1.1 ===

* The KEGG translated files are no longer included with the test-suite
  distribution.  They can be obtained separately from the following site:

  http://systems-biology.org/001/


=== Version 1.0.1 ===

* The following SBML Level 2 version 1 errata have been corrected in
  sbml-files/sbml-l2v1/from-spec:

    - l2v1-2D-compartments.xml: the "JO" in the MathML should really
      be a "J0" (the numeral zero, no the letter 'oh').

    - l2v1-boundary.xml: the one rule in listOfRules should not use
      <apply> ... </apply>; these tags should be omitted. Thanks to
      Bruce Shapiro for catching this.

    - l2v1-delay.xml: The definitionURL for the csymbol delay should
      be http://www.sbml.org/sbml/symbols/delay, not
      http://www.sbml.org/symbols/delay (the incorrect form has "sbml"
      omitted). Thanks to Marc Vass for catching this.

    - l2v1-mc-ode.xml: the MathML in the two rateRule definitions
      should not use <apply> ... </apply>; these tags should be
      omitted. Thanks to Bruce Shapiro for catching this.

* Released  7 August 2003


=== Version 1.0.0 ===

* Initial release, 29 June 2003.
