 In this model, a boundary species with 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits=true' is changing according to a rate rule, and is in a compartment which itself is changing due to a rate rule.  However, since the species is always described in terms of amount, the fact that its compartment is changing does not affect it.  This test ensures that simulators apply the rate rule to the species amount, and not to the species concentration.

The model contains:
* 1 species (S1)
* 1 compartment (c)

There are 2 rules:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
| Rate | S1 | $1$ |
| Rate | c | $1$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial amount of species S1 | $1.2$ | variable |
| Initial volume of compartment 'c' | $2$ | variable |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
