This test was written to ensure that if an AlgebraicRule with no Math child is encountered, it is ignored.

The model contains:
* 1 parameter (p)

There is one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
| Algebraic | $0$ | $$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial value of parameter p | $3$ | variable |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
