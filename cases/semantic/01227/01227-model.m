This test was written to check using the identifier of a reaction (J0) in a trigger.

The model contains:
* 1 species (S1)
* 1 parameter (k1)
* 1 compartment (c)

There is one reaction:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| J0: -> S1 | $k1$ |]


There is one event:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Event*  |  *Trigger*  | *Event Assignments* |
| _E0 | $time > J0$ | $k1 = 2$ |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial concentration of species S1 | $0$ | variable |
| Initial value of parameter k1 | $1.5$ | variable |
| Initial volume of compartment 'c' | $1$ | constant |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
