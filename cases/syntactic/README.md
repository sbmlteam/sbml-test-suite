The SBML Test Suite – Syntactic Test Cases
==========================================

This portion of the SBML Test Suite consists of syntactic test cases only.  These test models are provided for two purposes.  First, they are here simply to present malformed input for your [SBML](http://sbml.org) interpreter, to ensure that it deals with all contingencies in a graceful manner.  For interpreters that use [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) and only accept validated models, that step covers the majority of the cases herein.  However, there are many models with a variety of warnings that might cause problems for particular types of simulators – for example, models with uninitialized elements are valid SBML, but cannot be simulated without further input.  And interpreters that accept all SBML models regardless of that model's validation state should find this suite of models quite useful in uncovering any hidden assumptions about the models they interpret.

Second, SBML interpreters can use these files to test the way they report validation errors and warnings to the user.  Again, if the interpreter uses libSBML, this will be trivial: the files themselves were generated automatically with libSBML, after all.  But interpreters that use their own XML parsers, or which use JSBML, can use these files to detect differences in how those parsers interpret valid and invalid SBML models vs. how libSBML interprets those models.

The origin of these files
-------------------------

All the folders in this folder are auto-generated by the program `createSyntacticTests`, whose source code can be found in the subdirectory [test-suite/src/utilities/createSyntacticTests](../../src/utilities/createSyntacticTests). For more information on how to compile and run that program, please see the file [test-suite/src/utilities/createSyntacticTests/README.txt](../../src/utilities/createSyntacticTests/README.txt).


Interpretation of folders
-------------------------

When viewed from the top level, the cases are located in the subfolder `cases/syntactic/`.

Each folder is named after the validation rule that it tests.  Validation rules that appear in [SBML core specifications](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications) (starting from SBML Level 2 Version 2) are simply labeled with the number of the validation rule.  Validation messages that are not in the SBML core specification, but are used by libSBML have the numbers in the 80000-99999 range.  Those in the 80000-89999 range are warnings, and those in the 90000-99999 range are errors.

Validation rules from package specifications are given name and number combinations that come from each specification: `comp-xxxxx` rules come from the Hierarchical Model Composition package, `fbc-xxxxx` rules come from the Flux Balance Constraints package, `layout-xxxxx` rules come from the Layout package, and `qual-xxxxx` rules come from the Qualitative Models package.


Interpretation of file names
----------------------------

The format of each test file's name contains information about the
file itself.  Each name follows the following format:

```
[[pkg-]][rule#]-[pass/fail][[-extrarule#]]-[numfails]-[id#]-sev[#]-l[#]v[#]
```

Elements in double brackets (`[[]]`) are optional; elements in single brackets are mandatory but vary.

* [[`pkg-`]]: Optional: if the validation rule comes from a package, the name is prepended to the filename.  This matches the folder name.

* [`rule#`]: The validation rule (identified by its number) being tested.

* [`pass/fail`]: Either `fail`, if the model fails the validation rule being tested, or `pass`, if the model passes the validation rule being tested.

* [[`-extrarule#`]]: Optional: if the model also contains another error besides the one being tested, that validation error number is listed here.  If the model has additional validation warnings, those numbers are *not* listed.

* [`numfails`]: The number of times the model violates the validation rule being tested.

* [`id#`]: A two-digit number provided to uniquely identify the model from other models that test the same validation rule in the same way.

* `sev`[#]: `sev0` through `sev3`, indicating the severity of the validation rule being tested.  The vast majority of these are `sev1`, for warnings, or `sev2`, for errors.  `sev0` validation messages are informational only, and `sev3` errors are fatal.

* `l`[#]`v`[#]: The SBML Level and Version of the model.  Possible values are `l1v2`, `l2v1`, `l2v2`, `l2v3`, `l2v4`, `l2v5`, `l3v1` and `l3v2`.


Interpretation of `.txt` files
------------------------------

Along with each test model (XML file) is a text file with the same name, but ending in `.txt`. This file contains all the libSBML-generated error and warning messages for the model.  It is guaranteed that all of the error messages (if any) will be mentioned in the filename itself, either as the main validation rule being tested, or as the 'extra' rule number present in the model.  Each file may have multiple warning messages, however.  Each message in the file is demarcated by a line of dashes, and contains information as in this example from `10404-fail-01-04-sev2-l3v1.txt`:

```
Validation id    :	10404
Validation number:	10404
Severity         :	Error
Line number      :	17
Package          :	
Short message    :	Only one Annotation object is permitted under
a given SBML object
Full message     :	A given SBML object may contain at most one
<annotation> element.  Reference: L3V1 Section 3.2.  An SBML
<compartment> element with the id 'compartment_0000001' has
multiple <annotation> children.
```

The interpretation of each line is as follows:

* `Validation id`: The name of the validation error or warning found. 
If from an SBML core specification, it will simply be that validation number, and the same if it comes from libSBML itself and not a specification (ids between 80000 and 99999).  If from a package, the short name of the package will be used, i.e. `comp-10308`.

* `Validation number`: The number of the validation error or warning.  Will be the same as the validation id if from the core specifications or from libSBML, and will be a greater number if from a package.  `comp` validation numbers are the validation id plus 1000000; `fbc` validation numbers are the validation id plus 2000000; `qual` validation numbers are the validation ids plus 3000000; and `layout` validation numbers are the validation id plus 6000000.

* `Severity`: Either `Error` or `Warning`.

* `Line number`: The line number of the XML file where the validation
problem was found.

* `Package`: The short name of the package the message comes from.  Possibilities are `comp`, `fbc`, `layout`, `qual` and `` (if not from a package).

* `Short message`: A short description of the validation in question.

* `Full message`: A full description of the validation.  This is the full text of the validation description from the specification it came from, along with any specific information about how the model violated that validation.  In the above example, `A given SBML object may contain at most one <annotation> element.  Reference: L3V1 Section 3.2` is the text of the validation error in the SBML specification, and `An SBML <compartment> element with the id 'compartment_0000001' has multiple <annotation> children.` is the message (generated by libSBML) that explains how this particular model violated that validation error.


Interpretation of the file `uniqueErrors.txt`
---------------------------------------------

The file `uniqueErrors.txt` in the folder `cases/syntactic/` contains a list of every error represented by the test syntactic cases.


(Lack of) Integration with the rest of the SBML Test Suite
----------------------------------------------------------

As of this writing, the syntactic tests are not integrated into the SBML Test Suite Test Runner or the database of test results at [http://sbml.org/Facilities/Database](http://sbml.org/Facilities/Database).  The syntactic tests of the SBML Test Suite are distributed in order to encourage developers to begin investigating how they might be able to use these tests, but users and developers need to develop their own approaches to running the tests in software.
